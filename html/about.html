<h1>About Us</h1>
<br>
<h3>The organization</h3>
<p>With more than 7 years of experience (and counting), Tour With Josh is a tour operating company in Sri Lanka which organizes bird watching, bird photography tours. Tour With Josh team consists of expert birding tour guides mostly licensed from Sri Lanka Tourist board.
<br><br>
Our tours and excursions are personally organized by Josh (Joshap Caldera). Josh is one of the country's most experienced trekkers and birders as well as a top tour guide. Our mission is to give you a relaxing holiday, a wonderful tour and a taste of Sri Lanka as Sri Lankans live it.
<br><br>
Even though we are well established in Sri Lanka starting in about 2002, we are not a large-scale venture and we will not promote commercial sales aimed at tourists. Rather we ensure that our rates are reasonable, and that the money you spend will directly and positively affect people at the village level. We seek to improve the lives of the people who affect & conserve the bird habitats by buying products and services including home staying, guiding services etc. In our tours, you will have the rare opportunity to share experiences with local village people, visit their homes, and immerse yourself in their lives and culture.
<br><br>
From us, people around the world can get free travel advice and tips as well as bird information regarding Sri Lanka.</p>
