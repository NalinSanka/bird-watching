<h1>Bird watching tours in Sri Lanka</h1>
 
<p>This birding tour is mainly focused on birds of Sri Lanka with all endemic birds. We try to show you more than 200 birds including all 33 endemics in this tour. This is one of the best birding holidays you can get for an attractive price; an excellent bird watching tour for bird lovers.
<br><br>
For a small island Sri Lanka has a rich bird fauna, and many passionate bird lovers rank Sri Lanka among their favorite destinations.<br> 426 bird species have been seen in Sri Lanka, and 33 of these are endemic to Sri Lanka, that is, found nowhere else (this number<br> may soon be revised upwards based on a new taxonomic study). Between October and April, many migrants visit the isle,<br> traveling as far away as Siberia . Another noteworthy feature of Sri Lanka 's avifauna is the presence of mixed-species flocks,<br> which makes watching birds both easy and interesting, since one can study carefully the interactions between different species.
