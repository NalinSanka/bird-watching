<h1>About Sri Lanka Birding Trip Reports</h1>
<p>The main focus on this website is birding trip reports in Sri Lanka from tours done by <font color="blue">Tour With Josh</font>. All the tour reports are voluntarily provided to us by the clients who have traveled with us. And we have published the write-ups as it is with what ever they have written. If any alterations, they would be things like spell corrections, addition of images into long stretches of text.
<br><br>
  The format of the reports are as varied as well as the tourists have come to Sri Lanka from various parts of the world; England, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Hong Kong, etc.Our aim is to provide trip reports with text as well as videos and a lot of informative photos.We believe that better visuals, and also audio. will give a much richer sense of a tour supplementingna lengthy, descriptive and detailed text.</p>

<p>Hi Josh and Hetti. You may have thought I have forgotten about you but I haven't.since we were with you last year in May we have been traveling extensively.That has resulted in being very backlogged in processing photos from our trip. Tou may recall that even before our visit to Sri Lanka we were in Ethiopia, Egypt, U.A.E, Maldives, and Kerala and Tamil Nadu in Southern India. On the totl trip I took about 80,000 photos of which about 15,000 were in Sri Lanka alone. </p>
